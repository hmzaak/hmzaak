  <h1>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h1> 
  This is Hamza Kamal, a Computer Systems Engineer, and a learner. I have a passion for learning different things, languages, and frameworks. And in pursuit of learning,   I experiment with things and sometimes get failed and sometimes succeed. I posses a strong inclination towards Data Structures and Mobile App Development and am deeply   passionate about exploring and mastering these areas. As far as my development journey is concerned, I have started to explore Cross-Platform App Development in the     shape of Flutter/Dart. Along with that, I have experience with different programming languages, C/C++, Arduino, TypeScript, Python, Matlab, Dart/Flutter.
